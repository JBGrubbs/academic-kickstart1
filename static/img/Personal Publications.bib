	abstract = {Internet pornography usage has become widespread in recent years, and the task of assessing this usage has proven difficult. Furthermore, assessing this usage in religious populations has proven nearly impossible due to the morally charged nature of the subject. As such, this study recounts the development of a new instrument for assessing Internet pornography usage that could be effectively used in religious populations. Factor analyses of the instrument revealed a three-factor structure that demonstrated acceptable reliability (α {\textgreater}.80) for each factor, as well as some measure of construct validity. The instrument also offered initial analyses of the feelings of guilt and distress experienced by religious populations as a result of their Internet pornography consumption. These results demonstrate great potential for future clinical application as well as research, particularly in populations that are prone to experience more guilt as a result of their usage.},

	abstract = {Perceived addiction to Internet pornography is increasingly a focus of empirical attention. The present study examined the role that religious belief and moral disapproval of pornography use play in the experience of perceived addiction to Internet pornography. Results from two studies in undergraduate samples (Study 1, N = 331; Study 2, N = 97) indicated that there was a robust positive relationship between religiosity and perceived addiction to pornography and that this relationship was mediated by moral disapproval of pornography use. These results persisted even when actual use of pornography was controlled. Furthermore, although religiosity was negatively predictive of acknowledging any pornography use, among pornography users, religiosity was unrelated to actual levels of use. A structural equation model from a web-based sample of adults (Study 3, N = 208) revealed similar results. Specifically, religiosity was robustly predictive of perceived addiction, even when relevant covariates (e.g., trait self-control, socially desirable responding, neuroticism, use of pornography) were held constant. In sum, the present study indicated that religiosity and moral disapproval of pornography use were robust predictors of perceived addiction to Internet pornography while being unrelated to actual levels of use among pornography consumers.},

Participants (N = 187) reported a time in which they had violated their sexual values and completed measures of self-forgiveness, shame/guilt, and hypersexual behavior. Self-forgiveness was negatively related to hypersexual behavior. Self-forgiveness was also negatively related to shame/guilt.

	abstract = {Religious and spiritual struggles (R/S struggles)—tension or conﬂicts regarding religious or spiritual matters—have been robustly linked to greater psychological distress and lower well-being. Most research in this area has relied on samples consisting predominantly of participants who believe in god(s). Limited research has examined R/S struggles among atheists, generally conﬂating them with agnostics and other nontheists. This study investigated the prevalence of R/S struggles among atheists and compared atheists to theists in two samples (3978 undergraduates, 1048 Internet workers). Results of a multilevel model showed that atheists experience less demonic, doubt, divine, moral, and overall R/S struggles than theists, but similar levels of interpersonal and ultimate meaning struggles. Correlation and regression analyses among atheists demonstrated links between moral, ultimate meaning, and overall R/S struggles and greater distress (depression and anxiety symptoms) as well as lower well-being (life satisfaction and meaning in life). Even after controlling neuroticism, ultimate meaning struggles continued to predict lower well-being and higher distress across samples; moral struggles also predicted distress independently. This study demonstrates the relevance of R/S struggles to atheists and reinforces the applicability of previous results to atheist samples, but also highlights substantial differences between atheists and theists in certain R/S struggles.},

	abstract = {Research exploring nonbelievers’ reasons for not believing in the existence of god(s) has focused on theory development. Such efforts are valuable, but may not capture the lived experiences of nonbelievers. The current two studies quantitatively examined nonbelievers’ self-reported reasons for nonbelief through developing the Reasons of Atheists and Agnostics for Nonbelief in God’s Existence Scale (RANGES). We developed an initial pool of 64 items using prior published research, revised by a panel of experts including researchers and thought leaders in nonbelief communities. Both studies included participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Study 1 \& 2 Ns = 520 \& 369), all of whom reported not believing in god(s). In Study 1, our exploratory factor analysis suggested nine factors across 35 items. In Study 2, we confirmed the nine-factor structure using 38 items (35 from Study 1 plus three new items for better coverage of factors with few items) with adequate fit. Across both studies, the RANGES subscales showed good reliability, convergent validity (e.g., positive correlations with previous lists of reasons for religious doubt), predictive validity (e.g., positive and negative feelings toward God and religion), and discriminant validity (e.g., subscales were not unexpectedly associated with other measures). Our 1-year follow-up with a subset of Study 2 participants (N = 132) found different levels of stability among the RANGES subscales. This measure can promote further understanding the motivations, identities, and experiences of nonbelievers across cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Debates about classification, conceptualization, and categorization of narcissism and narcissistic traits continue to rage into the present. However, of all the current debates related to narcissism, perhaps the most intense and contentious are those related to generational differences in narcissism. Beginning in mid-2000s, research emerged suggesting that younger generations were more narcissistic than older generations, both cross-sectionally and cross-temporally. In response to these claims, numerous rebuttals and counterarguments emerged. These debates have continued into the present, with each side of this debate presenting new evidence or rebuttals within the past 2 years. The present chapter seeks to review and synthesize this disparate and contentious literature into a cohesive whole, highlighting clearly established findings, areas of contention, and areas of ongoing debate. Future directions for research are also proposed.},

	abstract = {Individuals with gambling disorder (GD) report much higher rates of post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS/D) than the general population, and individuals with both PTSS/D and GD often report much greater distress and impairment in daily life in comparison to individuals with GD alone (Grubbs, Chapman, Milner, Gutierrez, \& Bradley, 2018). Despite these associations, little is known about the specific ways in which PTSS/D and GD might influence each other. To address this gap in research, the present work sought to examine how PTSD might be related to the expression and experience of gambling related cognitions. Specifically, it was hypothesized that individuals with PTSD or symptoms of PTSD (i.e., subclinical levels of post-traumatic stress) would demonstrate greater cognitive distortions and erroneous beliefs about gambling. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed data from two samples, an inpatient sample of U.S. Armed Forces veterans seeking treatment for gambling disorder (n = 332) and an online sample of largely recreational gambling U.S. adults (n = 589). Results consistently revealed that, in both samples, individuals with PTSD or symptoms of PTSD were likely to report greater gambling related cognitions. These findings persisted, even when gambling symptom severity and trait neuroticism were held constant. Collectively, these results suggest that PTSD is uniquely associated with greater cognitive distortions and erroneous beliefs about gambling behaviors. These findings bear distinct implications for current understandings of how PTSS/D and GD are related, as well as for treatment of individuals with dealing with this comorbidity.},

	isbn = {978-1-138-19320-8},
	abstract = {The concept of sexual addiction has gained increasing recognition in the academic and healthcare communities since the 1990s. It has also captured the attention of the media, where there has been much debate over whether it can truly be described as an addiction. What is certain is that many people struggle with out of control sexual behaviour, which takes over their lives and has harmful consequences for their relationships, careers and finances. The Routledge International Handbook of Sexual Addiction brings together a comprehensive range of perspectives on sexual addiction from a worldwide selection of scholars and therapists. It sets out to define sexual addiction and to study its causes from a range of different psychological perspectives. A series of presentations of sexual addiction are outlined, including internet sexual addiction and the relationship between paraphilias and sex addiction. The handbook considers both individual and group treatment strategies, drawing on a wide range of approaches, including cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness and 12-step programmes. The book studies sex addiction in specific populations including women, adolescents and men who have sex with men. Finally, it considers some of the alternative discourses surrounding the concept of sexual addiction.  This is the first comprehensive reference book to bring together global viewpoints on advances in research, theory and practice in one volume. This handbook provides an essential guide for academics and students of psychotherapy, counselling, nursing, addiction, sexualities, social work and health and social care, as well as professionals in practice and in training working with sexual addiction and related issues.},

	abstract = {Problem gambling and gambling disorder (GD) are associated with a range of mental health concerns that extend beyond gambling behaviors alone. Prior works have consistently linked gambling disorder with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), both cross-sectionally and over time. However, very little work has examined the specific relationships between these 2 disorders. The present work postulated that symptoms of PTSD are likely associated with unique beliefs about gambling behaviors and unique motivations to gamble. Using 2 samples—an inpatient sample of U.S. Armed Forces veterans (N = 332) seeking treatment for GD and a Web-sample of gambling adults (N = 589)—we examined these ideas. Results from both samples indicated that symptoms of PTSD were related to positive gambling expectancies and coping motivations for gambling. Additionally, in both samples, positive gambling expectancies were associated with greater coping motivations for gambling. Structural equation models revealed that positive gambling expectancies were consistently associated with coping motivations for gambling. The findings indicate that symptoms of PTSD are likely associated with unique beliefs about and motivations for gambling behaviors. Given the high comorbidity between symptoms of PTSD and GD, these specific relationships are likely of clinical interest in populations seeking treatment for either PTSD or for problems with gambling behaviors.

	abstract = {Purpose of ReviewThe current review summarizes the latest findings concerning neurobiological mechanisms of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) and provides recommendations for future research specific to the diagnostic classification of the condition.Recent FindingsTo date, most neuroimaging research on compulsive sexual behavior has provided evidence of overlapping mechanisms underlying compulsive sexual behavior and non-sexual addictions. Compulsive sexual behavior is associated with altered functioning in brain regions and networks implicated in sensitization, habituation, impulse dyscontrol, and reward processing in patterns like substance, gambling, and gaming addictions. Key brain regions linked to compulsive sexual behavior features include the frontal and temporal cortices, amygdala, and striatum, including the nucleus accumbens.SummaryDespite much neuroscience research finding many similarities between CSBD and substance and behavioral addictions, the World Health Organization included CSBD in the ICD-11 as an impulse-control disorder. Although previous research has helped to highlight some underlying mechanisms of the condition, additional investigations are needed to fully understand this phenomenon and resolve classification issues surrounding CSBD.},

For veterans and non-veterans alike, religious/spiritual beliefs and practices support recovery from addiction and bolster mental health and well-being. Moreover, religious/spiritual ideas pervade Gamblers Anonymous (GA), which remains the predominant community-based treatment modality for GD. However, research has increasingly highlighted the negative impact of religious/spiritual struggles—i.e., conflicts, tensions, or problems associated with aspects of religious/spiritual life—on mental health and well-being. To date, no research has examined the role of religious/spiritual struggles in GD. The current study aimed to fill that gap in the literature by assessing the prevalence and impact of religious/spiritual struggles among U.S. veterans (N = 157) admitted to a residential treatment program for GD. Findings showed that a majority of veterans in the gambling treatment program endorsed each of six types of religious/spiritual struggles assessed. Moral struggles were the most prevalent, severe, and unremitting of the religious/spiritual struggles assessed. Findings highlight the need for clinicians and chaplains working with problem gamblers to address religious/spiritual struggles generally, and moral struggles most specifically, in treatment of GD.},

	abstract = {Both academic and popular literatures have repeatedly contended that emerging adults are the most narcissistic and entitled age-group in modern times. Although this contention is fiercely debated, the message that emerging adults are narcissistic and entitled has saturated popular culture. Despite this saturation, relatively little empirical work has examined how emerging adults might react to such labels. Across three studies in five samples in the U.S., the present work sought to address this deficit in research. Results from cross-sectional samples of university students at two universities, as well as an online convenience sample of web-using adults (Study 1), indicated that emerging adults believe their agegroup and the one following them (e.g., adolescents) to be the most narcissistic and entitled age-groups, that they have generally negative opinions of narcissism and entitlement, and that they respond negatively to being labeled as narcissistic and entitled. Additionally, results from adult web-users revealed that, while all age groups tend to view adolescents and emerging adults as more narcissistic and entitled than older age-groups, these opinions are more exaggerated among members of older age-groups. Finally, across two experimental studies (Studies 2 \& 3), results indicated that emerging adults react negatively to labeling of their age-group as narcissistic and entitled, but no more negatively than they do to potentially related undesirable labels (e.g., oversensitive). Collectively, these results indicate that emerging adults are aware of and somewhat distressed by messaging that casts their agegroup as the most narcissistic and entitled age-group ever.},

	abstract = {Gambling disorder and symptoms of post-traumatic stress are highly comorbid. Numerous studies suggest that the presence of one (either disordered gambling or post-traumatic stress) substantially increases the odds of later developing the other. However, little is known about the etiological links between these two domains or the nuances of the comorbidity. Past research has suggested that symptoms of post-traumatic stress might be related to unique motivations for and beliefs about gambling. The present work sought to examine whether or not symptoms of post-traumatic stress might also be related to specific situational vulnerabilities to gambling behaviors. Using a large cross-sectional sample of Internet-using adults in the United States who were primarily recreational gamblers (N = 743; 46\% men, Mage = 36.0, SD = 11.1), as well as an inpatient sample of US Armed Forces veterans seeking treatment for gambling disorder (N = 332, 80\% men, Mage = 53.5, SD = 11.5), the present work tested whether or not symptoms of post-traumatic stress were uniquely related to a variety of gambling situations. Results in both samples revealed that even when controlling for potentially confounding variables (eg, substance use and trait impulsivity), symptoms of post-traumatic stress were uniquely related to gambling in response to negative affect, gambling in response to social pressure, and gambling due to a need for excitement. These findings are consistent with recent work suggesting that individuals with post-traumatic stress symptoms are more likely to engage in gambling behaviors for unique reasons that differ from gamblers without such symptoms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite controversies regarding its existence as a legitimate mental health condition, self-reports of pornography addiction seem to occur regularly. In the United States, prior works using various sampling techniques, such as undergraduate samples and online convenience samples, have consistently demonstrated that some pornography users report feeling dysregulated or out of control in their use. Even so, there has been very little work in US nationally representative samples to examine self-reported pornography addiction. METHODS: This study sought to examine self-reported pornography addiction in a US nationally representative sample of adult Internet users (N = 2,075). RESULTS: The results indicated that most participants had viewed pornography within their  lifetimes (n = 1,461), with just over half reporting some use in the past year (n = 1,056). Moreover, roughly 11\% of men and 3\% of women reported some agreement with the statement "I am addicted to pornography." Across all participants, such  feelings were most strongly associated with male gender, younger age, greater religiousness, greater moral incongruence regarding pornography use, and greater  use of pornography. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings are consistent with prior works that have noted that self-reported pornography addiction is a complex phenomenon that is predicted by both objective behavior and subjective moral evaluations of that behavior.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite evidence to the contrary, a number of advocacy and self-help groups persist in claiming that internet pornography use is driving an  epidemic of erectile dysfunction (ED). AIM: The present work sought to explore whether mere pornography use itself and self-reported problematic use of pornography are related to ED, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. METHODS: A series of 3 samples of sexually active men who also used pornography were collected: a cross-sectional sample of undergraduate men in the United States (n = 147), an online sample of men derived from a larger sample that was matched to U.S. nationally representative norms (n = 297), and a 1-year, 4-wave longitudinal sample of adult men derived from an online convenience sample (Mechanical Turk: time 1, n = 433; time 2, n = 223; time 3, n = 202; time 4, n =  196). Pearson correlations and cross-sectional structural equation models were conducted in each sample. Latent growth curve analyses were conducted in the longitudinal sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcomes of interest were  cross-sectional and longitudinal reports of erectile functioning as measured by the International Index of Erectile Functioning 5. RESULTS: Across all 3 samples, there was evidence of a positive, cross-sectional association between self-reported problematic use and ED, but no consistent association between mere  use itself and ED. In our longitudinal sample, there were correlations among baseline pornography use, baseline self-reported problematic use, and prospective ED at times 2-4; however, latent growth curve analyses demonstrated no significant relationships between any pornography-related variables and trajectories of ED. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that among non-treatment-seeking pornography users, self-reported problematic use likely is  associated with concurrent reports of ED, but that the links between these variables are not directional or causal in nature. STRENGTH \& LIMITATIONS: This work is the first work to systematically examine the links between self-reported  problematic use of pornography and ED, and it did so in a variety of samples, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal methods. Even so, the work relied exclusively on self-report methods, and did not control for medical covariates that may be related to the experience of ED. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with prior literature, we conclude that there is little or no evidence of an association between mere pornography use and ED, consistent evidence of an association between self-reported problematic use and ED cross-sectionally, and no evidence of causal links between any pornography variables and ED.

	abstract = {The notion of problematic pornography use remains contentious in both academic and popular literature. Although the mental health community at large is divided  as to the addictive versus non-addictive nature of Internet pornography, substantial numbers of individuals report "feeling" as if their use of Internet pornography is problematic. The present work seeks to construct a model related to problematic pornography use that is clearly derived from empirical literature  and that provides directions to be tested in future research. The focus of the present work is on those perceptions as they relate to the overarching experience of moral incongruence in pornography use, which is generally thought of as the experience of having one's behaviors be inconsistent with one's beliefs. To this  end, we put forth a model of pornography problems due to moral incongruence. Within this model, we describe how pornography-related problems-particularly feelings of addiction to pornography-may be, in many cases, better construed as functions of discrepancies-moral incongruence-between pornography-related beliefs and pornography-related behaviors. A systematic review of literature and meta-analysis is conducted in order to evaluate support for this model, and the implications of this model for research and clinical practice are discussed.},

	abstract = {In recent years, several works have reported on perceived addiction to internet pornography, or the potential for some individuals to label their own use of pornography as compulsive or out of control. Such works have consistently found that perceived addiction is related to concerning outcomes such as psychological  distress, relational distress, and other addictive behaviors. However, very little work has specifically examined whether or not perceived addiction is actually related to increased use of pornography, cross-sectionally or over time. The present work sought to address this deficit in the literature. Using two longitudinal samples (Sample 1, Baseline N=3988; Sample 2, Baseline N=1047), a variety of factors (e.g., male gender, lower religiousness, and lower self-control) were found to predict any use of pornography. Among those that acknowledged use (Sample 1, Baseline N=1352; Sample 2, Baseline N=793), perceived addiction to pornography consistently predicted greater average daily use of pornography. At subsequent longitudinal follow-ups (Sample 1, Baseline N=265; Sample 2, One Month Later, N=410, One Year Later, N=360), only male gender and baseline average pornography use consistently predicted future use. These findings suggest that perceived addiction to pornography is associated with concurrent use of pornography, but does not appear to predict use over time, suggesting that perceived addiction may not always be an accurate indicator of behavior or addiction.},

	abstract = {Internet pornography use (IPU) remains a controversial topic within sexual behavior research fields. Whereas some people report feeling dysregulated in their use of pornography, mental health and medical communities are divided as to whether IPU can be addictive. The present review sought to examine this issue more closely, with a focus on how variables other than pornography use, such as moral disapproval and moral incongruence (i.e., feeling as if one's behaviors and one's values about those behaviors are misaligned), might specifically contribute to self-perceived problems around pornography use. Through an examination of recent literature, the present work reviews evidence that moral incongruence about IPU is a common phenomenon and that it is associated with outcomes relevant to current debates about pornography addiction. Specifically, moral incongruence  regarding IPU appears to be associated with greater distress about IPU, greater psychological distress in general, greater reports of problems related to IPU, and greater reports of perceived addiction to IPU. The implications of this body  of evidence for both clinical and research communities are discussed, and future  directions for research are considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Internet pornography use is an increasingly common, yet controversial, behavior. Whereas mental health communities are divided about potentially problematic use patterns, many lay people identify as feeling dysregulated or compulsive in their use. Prior work has labeled this tendency perceived addiction to internet pornography (PA). This study's aims were to (1) assess the association between PA at baseline and other factors, including actual levels of average daily pornography use and personality factors and (2) assess the associations between baseline variables and PA 1 year later. DESIGN: Two large-scale community samples were assessed using online survey methods, with subsets of each sample being recruited for follow-up surveys 1 year later. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were adults who had used pornography within the past 6 months recruited in two samples. Sample 1 (n = 1507) involved undergraduate students from three US universities and sample 2 (n  = 782) involved web-using adults. Subsets of each sample (sample 1, n = 146; sample 2, n = 211) were surveyed again 1 year later. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, we assessed average daily pornography use, PA and relevant predictors (e.g. trait neuroticism, trait self-control, trait entitlement, religiousness, moral disapproval of pornography use). One year later, we assessed PA. FINDINGS: Cross-sectionally, PA was correlated strongly with moral disapproval of pornography use [sample 1, Pearson's correlation: r = 0.68 (0.65, 0.70); sample 2, r = 0.58 (0.53, 0.63)]. Baseline moral disapproval [sample 1, r = 0.46 (0.33,  0.56); sample 2, r = 0.61 (0.51, 0.69)] and perceived addiction demonstrated relationships with perceived addiction 1 year later. We found inconclusive evidence of a substantial or significant association between pornography use and  perceived addiction over time [sample 1, r = 0.13 (-0.02, 0.28); sample 2, r = 0.11 (-0.04, 0.25)]. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived addiction to internet pornography appears to be related strongly to moral scruples around pornography use, both concurrently and over time, rather than with the amount of daily pornography use  itself.},

	abstract = {Prior work has demonstrated that religious beliefs and moral attitudes are often  related to sexual functioning. The present work sought to examine another possibility: Do sexual attitudes and behaviors have a relationship with religious and spiritual functioning? More specifically, do pornography use and perceived addiction to Internet pornography predict the experience of religious and spiritual struggle? It was expected that feelings of perceived addiction to Internet pornography would indeed predict such struggles, both cross-sectionally  and over time, but that actual pornography use would not. To test these ideas, two studies were conducted using a sample of undergraduate students (N = 1519) and a sample of adult Internet users in the U.S. (N = 713). Cross-sectional analyses in both samples found that elements of perceived addiction were related  to the experience of religious and spiritual struggle. Additionally, longitudinal analyses over a 1-year time span with a subset of undergraduates (N = 156) and a  subset of adult web users (N = 366) revealed that perceived addiction to Internet pornography predicted unique variance in struggle over time, even when baseline levels of struggle and other related variables were held constant. Collectively,  these findings identify perceived addiction to Internet pornography as a reliable predictor of religious and spiritual struggle.},

This model was replicated using a large cross-sectional sample of undergraduates (N = 1,215). Furthermore, a 1-year, longitudinal follow-up with a subset of this sample (N = 106) revealed a relationship between  perceived addiction to Internet pornography and psychological distress over time, even when controlling for baseline psychological distress and pornography use.

The authors developed and refined a short 9-item measure of perceived addiction to Internet pornography, confirmed its structure in multiple samples, examined its relatedness to hypersexuality more broadly, and demonstrated that the notion of perceived addiction to Internet pornography is very robustly related to various measures of psychological distress. Furthermore, the relation between psychological distress and the new measure persisted, even when other potential contributors (e.g., neuroticism, self-control, amount of time spent viewing pornography) were controlled for statistically, indicating the clinical relevance of assessing perceived addiction to Internet pornography.},

	abstract = {Psychological entitlement is a personality trait characterized by pervasive feelings of deservingness, specialness, and exaggerated expectations. The present review expands upon this understanding by conceptualizing entitlement as a cognitive-personality vulnerability to psychological distress. A review of research is conducted, and a novel, multipart model is described by which entitlement may be seen as such a vulnerability. First, exaggerated expectations, notions of the self as special, and inflated deservingness associated with trait entitlement present the individual with a continual vulnerability to unmet expectations. Second, entitled individuals are likely to interpret these unmet expectations in ways that foster disappointment, ego threat, and a sense of perceived injustice, all of which may lead to psychological distress indicators such as dissatisfaction across multiple life domains, anger, and generally volatile emotional responses. Furthermore, in the wake of disappointment, ego threat, or perceived injustice, entitled individuals are likely to attempt to bolster their entitled self-concept, leading to a reinforcement of entitled beliefs, thereby initiating the cycle again. At each stage of this process, entitlement presents the individual with the possibility of experiencing distress, predisposes further risk factors for distress (e.g., the subsequent steps in the model), and increases the risk of interpersonal conflict, again leading to distress. A review of relevant empirical data suggests preliminary support for this conceptual model of entitlement.},

	abstract = {Public discourse is often caustic and conflict-filled. This trend seems to be particularly evident when the content of such discourse is around moral issues (broadly defined) and when the discourse occurs on social media. Several explanatory mechanisms for such conflict have been explored in recent psychological and social-science literatures. The present work sought to examine a potentially novel explanatory mechanism defined in philosophical literature: Moral Grandstanding. According to philosophical accounts, Moral Grandstanding is the use of moral talk to seek social status. For the present work, we conducted six studies, using two undergraduate samples (Study 1, N = 361; Study 2, N = 356); a sample matched to U.S. norms for age, gender, race, income, Census region (Study 3, N = 1,063); a YouGov sample matched to U.S. demographic norms (Study 4, N = 2,000); and a brief, one-month longitudinal study of Mechanical Turk workers in the U.S. (Study 5, Baseline N = 499, follow-up n = 296), and a large, one-week YouGov sample matched to U.S. demographic norms (Baseline N = 2,519, follow-up n = 1,776). Across studies, we found initial support for the validity of Moral Grandstanding as a construct. Specifically, moral grandstanding motivation was associated with status-seeking personality traits, as well as greater political and moral conflict in daily life.},

The present work sought to examine whether beliefs about gambling, such as positive expectations for gambling, may be related to coping motivations for gambling over time and how both might be related to problem gambling behavior. Additionally, the present study sought to establish these relationships above and beyond trait neuroticism. To accomplish these goals, a 6-month longitudinal survey study of Internet using adults was conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were adults in the United States who acknowledged gambling in some form over the 12 months prior to the survey (N ϭ 812; Mage ϭ 36.00, SD ϭ 11.10; 45.6\% men). A subset of this sample (n ϭ 373) participated in a follow-up survey 6 months after the original survey. Cross-sectional correlations revealed robust associations between coping motivations, positive expectancies, and problem gambling. Structural equation models revealed unique associations between baseline coping motivations for gambling and future problem gambling over a 6-month period, even when controlling for baseline gambling behaviors. Additionally, baseline neuroticism predicted future coping motivations for gambling after controlling for baseline coping motivations.},

Recent research has suggested that entitlement might have domain-specific manifestations such as romantic entitlement, academic entitlement, and sexual entitlement. The present work sought to examine such a domain specific manifestation in the religious and spiritual realm. This new manifestation was called divine entitlement. The present studies sought to validate this construct and demonstrate its associations with concerning, domain-relevant outcomes. In 2 studies using 6 samples (Study 1, total N ϭ 556; Study 2, Total N ϭ 2,113) divine entitlement was validated as a construct and the Divine Entitlement Scale was developed and validated as a brief measure of this construct. Subsequent structural equation models found that divine entitlement also has a positive, predictive relationship with spiritual struggles with the divine. Through this association (divine entitlement with divine struggle), there was also an indirect association of divine entitlement with psychological distress more broadly. Collectively, these findings illustrate that entitlement may also be exhibited in a domainspecific manner in one’s religious and spiritual life and that this domain-specific manifestation may also have concerning outcomes in both religious and spiritual life and mental health more generally.},

	abstract = {At present, the scientific community has not reached a consensus regarding whether or not people may be become addicted to or compulsive in use of pornography. Even so, a substantial number of people report feeling that their use of pornography is dysregulated or out of control. Whereas prior works considered self-reported feelings of addiction via indirect scales or dimensional measures, the present work examined what might lead someone to specifically identify as a pornography addict. Consistent with prior research, pre-registered hypotheses predicted that religiousness, moral disapproval, and average daily pornography use would emerge as consistent predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. Four samples, involving adult pornography users (Sample 1, N = 829, Mage = 33.3; SD = 9.4; Sample 2, N = 424, Mage = 33.6; SD = 9.1; Sample 4, N = 736, Mage = 48.0; SD = 15.8) and undergraduates (Sample 3, N = 231, Mage = 19.3; SD = 1.8), were collected. Across all three samples, male gender, moral incongruence, and average daily pornography use consistently emerged as predictors of self-identification as a pornography addict. In contrast to prior literature indicating that moral incongruence and religiousness are the best predictors of self-reported feelings of addiction (measured dimensionally), results from all four samples indicated that male gender and average daily pornography use were the most strongly associated with self-identification as a pornography addict, although moral incongruence consistently emerged as a robust and unique predictors of such self-identification.},

However, SLE may aggregate, gradually undermining individuals’ orienting systems. Does SLE accumulation predict greater R/S struggles? Might general religiousness buffer cumulative effects of SLE on R/S struggles? We tested these hypotheses using religiousness and 19 kinds of SLE as predictors of the 6-factor Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale. Using measurement invariance constraints on four samples from 3 universities and the Internet (total N ϭ 4,675), cumulative SLE independently predicted greater R/S struggles of all kinds in all samples equally. Thus, heightened R/S struggles tend to accompany accumulated SLE. However, the interaction of religiousness and SLE failed to predict R/S struggles, yielding no support for the buffering hypothesis. Stress-exposed populations face R/S struggles of many kinds, regardless of religiousness. We recommend tests of the buffering hypothesis targeting aspects of religious orienting systems that connect more directly to R/S struggles.},

In two US samples – a web-based sample (N = 1047) and an undergraduate sample (N = 3978) – confirmatory factor analyses showed that struggle with ultimate meaning loaded on a factor that was distinct from but related to presence (negatively) and search (positively). Moderated regression analyses showed that people with low levels of presence combined with high levels of search for meaning were particularly likely to struggle with ultimate meaning. Additionally, when compared to presence and search, struggle with ultimate meaning related more strongly to depressive symptoms than presence or search. These results suggest that struggle with ultimate meaning represents a distinct component of how people grapple with meaning that has implications for mental health.},

Recent state-level analyses have put forward a controversial suggestion that religious individuals tend to search for pornography more than their less-religious peers, despite self-reports to the contrary. Such results could be explained by a social-desirability bias against reporting the consumption of pornography, one that applies specifically to religious individuals. Though our findings are limited to undergraduates in the U.S. Midwest, we found some evidence that the desire to positively self-present (as measured by the Marlowe–Crowne social desirability scale) may bias reports of pornography consumption and perceptions of pornography’s effects (e.g., perceptions of addictiveness). However, contrary to popular sentiment—and our own hypotheses—we found no evidence for and much evidence against the suggestion that religious individuals have a more pronounced social desirability bias against the reporting of pornography consumption than the irreligious. Interaction terms assessing that possibility were either nonsignificant or significant in the reverse direction.},

We argue that the move toward Open Science is beneficial for all six of the defining principles outlined by Grand et al. Open Science increases transparency, facilitates replication, and contributes to the accumulation and integration of research by increasing accessibility. Each of these factors helps to foster systematic, rigorous scientific practices, which, in turn, can lead to greater insights and understanding of organizational phenomenon through deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches to theory generation and refinement, ensuring that our field remains relevant for the foreseeable future. In this commentary, we highlight several initiatives that already exist to promote Open Science and explore others only alluded to by Grand et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction
To date, multiple models of problematic pornography use have been proposed, but attempts to validate them have been scarce.
Aim
In our study, we aimed to evaluate the Pornography Problems due to Moral Incongruence model proposing that self-appraisals of pornography addiction stem from (i) general dysregulation, (ii) habits of use, and (iii) moral incongruence between internalized norms and behavior. We investigated whether the model can be used to adequately explain the self-perceptions of addiction to pornography (model 1) and a broader phenomenon of problematic pornography use (model 2).
Methods
An online, nationally representative study was conducted on a sample of 1036 Polish adult participants, of whom, 880 declared a lifetime history of viewing pornography.
Main Outcome Measure
The outcomes were self-perceived pornography addiction, problematic pornography use, avoidant coping, frequency of pornography use, religiosity, moral disapproval of pornography, and related variables.
Results
Our results indicated that avoidant coping (an indicator of general dysregulation), frequency of pornography use (indicator of habits of use), and the distress connected with incongruence between own sexual behavior and internalized norms, attitudes and beliefs positively contributed to self-perceived addiction (model 1) as well as problematic pornography use (model 2). This broadly confirms the basic shape of the PPMI model. There were, however, notable differences between the models. Moral incongruence related distress was only weakly related to self-perceived addiction (β = 0.15, P {\textless} .001), with a stronger relation for problematic pornography use (β = 0.31, P {\textless} .001). When controlling for other factors, religiosity weakly predicted problematic pornography use (β = 0.13, P {\textless} .001), but not self-perceived addiction to pornography (β = 0.03, P = .368). Frequency of pornography use was the strongest predictor of both self-perceived addiction (β = 0.52, P {\textless} .001) and problematic pornography use (β = 0.43, P {\textless} .001).
Clinical Implications
Factors proposed within the PPMI model are distinctly relevant intervention targets, and they should be considered in the process of diagnosis and treatment.
Strengths \& Limitations
The presented study is the first to evaluate PPMI model. Its main limitation is that it has a cross-sectional design.
Conclusion
The PPMI model is a promising framework for investigating the factors related to self-perceived addiction and problematic pornography use. Despite the differences between the models and in the strength of specific predictors, (i) dysregulation, (ii) habits of use, and (iii) moral incongruence all uniquely contribute to self-perceived addiction and problematic pornography use.

This work consolidates research about pornography use into an organizational structure that is relevant to sexual motivation more broadly. To accomplish this, a comprehensive review of research is conducted, examining personality, emotional, and attitudinal associates and predictors of pornography use, as well as behaviours, attitudes, and motivations that are associated with or predicted by pornography use. Reviewing over 130 studies, the present work demonstrates that pornography is most often consumed for pleasure-seeking purposes, that it associated with increases in casual or impersonal approaches to sexuality, and that it predicts more pleasure-oriented approaches to sexual behaviour. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Many people experience struggle around religious and spiritual aspects of life, as shown in a steadily growing body of research. A need now exists for more comprehensive, reliable, concise measurement of religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles through a scale that covers multiple domains. This article describes the development and initial validation of a 26-item measure, the Religious and Spiritual Struggles (RSS) Scale. The measure assesses six domains of r/s struggle: divine (negative emotion centered on beliefs about God or a perceived relationship with God), demonic (concern that the devil or evil spirits are attacking an individual or causing negative events), interpersonal (concern about negative experiences with religious people or institutions; interpersonal conflict around religious issues), moral (wrestling with attempts to follow moral principles; worry or guilt about perceived offenses by the self), doubt (feeling troubled by doubts or questions about one’s r/s beliefs), and ultimate meaning (concern about not perceiving deep meaning in one’s life). Study 1 used factor analytic techniques in two adult samples (Ns ϭ 400 and 483) to refine the item pool for the RSS. Study 2, which sampled 1141 undergraduates, showed very good fit for a six-factor model using confirmatory factor analysis. Study 2 also provided evidence of convergent, discriminant and predictive validity by relating RSS scores to measures of religiousness, r/s struggle and mental health. Several potentially important demographic differences emerged on the RSS. For example, undergraduates without committed romantic relationships and those who self-identified as homosexual reported greater r/s struggles across multiple domains.},

	abstract = {Religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles have been robustly linked to negative outcomes, such as greater psychological distress, reduced well-being, and difficulty finding meaning in life. R/s struggles, however, do not inevitably lead to decline. Many people report post-traumatic and spiritual growth through their r/s struggles, even though correlational studies linking r/s struggles to perceptions of growth have produced mixed results. How do we make sense of this overall pattern of findings? Perhaps growth following r/s struggles occurs under certain conditions. Prior conceptual work by Pargament suggests that specific aspects of one\&rsquo;s orienting system (i.e., the confluence of r/s, dispositional, and psychosocial factors which help guide people in their search for significance and purpose) may play a pivotal role in predicting growth or decline in the wake of an r/s struggle. In the present empirical study, we expected to find that among r/s strugglers, those with orienting systems marked by greater wholeness would be more likely to report growth and less decline. Four dimensions of greater wholeness (purposiveness, breadth and depth, life affirmation, cohesiveness) were measured by the presence of meaning in one\&rsquo;s life, self-control, universality, optimism, compassion, openness to change while tolerating doubt, and a collaborative problem-solving relationship with God. We tested these hypotheses using data from a cross-sectional study (N = 1162) of undergraduates at three universities. Results generally supported our hypotheses, with a few exceptions. Greater wholeness was associated with reports of more growth and less decline after an r/s struggle.},

	abstract = {In 1998, Gold and Heffner authored a landmark review in Clinical Psychology Review on the topic of sexual addiction that concluded that sexual addiction, though increasingly popular in mental health settings, was largely based on speculation, with virtually no empirical basis. In the more than two decades since that review, empirical research around compulsive sexual behaviors (which subsumes prior research about sexual addiction) has flourished, ultimately culminating in the inclusion of a novel diagnosis of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder in the eleventh edition of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases. The present work details a systematic review of empirical research published between January 1st, 1995 and August 1st, 2020 related to compulsive sexual behaviors, with a specific focus on evaluating the methodologies of that literature. This review yielded 371 papers detailing 415 individual studies. In general, the present review finds that, although research related to compulsive sexual behaviors has proliferated, much of this work is characterized by simplistic methodological designs, a lack of theoretical integration, and an absence of quality measurement. Moreover, the present review finds a virtual absence of high-quality treatment-related research published within this time frame. Implications of these findings for both clinical practice and future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Sacred moments refer to experiences during which people perceive they encountered the sacred. The goal of the present study was to identify potential salutary effects of experiencing sacred moments over time. Participants included 2,889 adults (M age = 45.46 years; SD = 14.65) who completed online self-report questionnaires at baseline (T1) and 2 weeks (T2), 4 weeks (T3), 3 months (T4), and 6 months (T5) after baseline. Sacred moments were significantly related to engagement in religious and spiritual (r/s) activities and r/s belief salience at the T1 assessment. Relations between sacred moments and mental health variables over time were examined by conducting bivariate latent growth curve models (LCGMs). We included age, sex, and participation in r/s activities (measured at T1) as time-invariant covariates of intercepts and slopes for all variables. Results from LCGMs indicated that people who had higher levels of sacred moments over the course of the study had greater levels of mental health. In addition, people with lower levels of mental health overall were more likely to experience increases in sacred moments over time. Finally, people who had higher levels of sacred moments at baseline showed no change in level of perceived stress, depressed distress, or anxious distress. The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and future directions for research, as well as the potential benefits of helping individuals cultivate the sacred in their daily lives.

	abstract = {The population of religious “nones,” those who do not affiliate with any religion, is continually growing. Many of those who identify as nones have exited from religious traditions. Sparse research has examined the psychological processes involved in religious exit. Although various theories of religious exit have been proposed, they have provided limited empirical utility for psychological research. Immigration psychology, with its empirically well-established paradigms, may provide a better theoretical basis with which to understand religious exit. More specifically, the push (from origin group) and pull (towards destination group) theory of migration may be useful in understanding what motivates individuals to leave religions, and the individual psychological experiences of the religious exit process. Further, the push and pull theory may inform the trajectories of disaffiliates and their psychological wellbeing and adjustment post religious exit. This study’s main aim was to empirically establish a measure of push-pull forces for religious exit. To accomplish this goal, Latent Variable Modeling was performed to reduce a larger push-pull item bank (38 items) to a brief 8-item scale. Hypothesis testing using correlation and Structural Equation Modeling demonstrated that push and pull are associated with mental health outcomes for those leaving religions.},

We theorize that libertarian and authoritarian impulses within Christian nationalism undergirded much of the resistance to government restrictions. Analyzing national panel data collected before and during the pandemic, we find Christian nationalism is either the first or second strongest predictor that Americans prioritize the economy and liberty and deprioritize the vulnerable when asked about government restrictions. Religiosity works in the opposite direction, however. Findings underscore the centrality of Christian nationalism as an ideological driver of far-right discourse shaping COVID-19 responses.},

	abstract = {The Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale (RSS) measures important psychological constructs involved in the complex relationship between religion and well-being. Religious/spiritual struggles are distinct from religiousness, distress, and each other, but the RSS’ internal discriminant validity has not been tested longitudinally. Previously, we published three alternative measurement models with a large sample of undergraduates in the USA (N = 3851), including two bifactor models with unidentified general factors. We reused this sample as our baseline measurement, and tested each measurement model’s ability to predict new measurements collected a year later (n = 583). Both general factors predicted themselves best over time with strength and specificity similar to the original six group factors, all of which also predicted themselves strongly and specifically in all three models. Correlations one year after baseline weakened slightly but remained positive, continuing to reflect both the general and group factors’ mutual influence. All group and general factors appear valid and meaningfully different as independent psychological constructs. Significant evidence that certain RSS factors independently predict certain others only emerged in the restricted bifactor model, where we least expected it. These effects did not diminish discriminant validity, but suggested subtle ways that some R/S struggles could predict changes in others, pending replication of these results. Overall, the RSS appears to measure distinct phases that are more stable than states, yet more transitory than traits. The RSS is well-suited to longitudinal research into many important questions about the dynamics of R/S struggles, which we discuss within.},

Drawing on data from available waves of the General Social Surveys (1988–2018: nmen = 6590, nwomen = 7047; 1989–2018: nmen = 3558, nwomen = 4841), this study extended moral incongruence theory by testing whether engaging in same-sex or non-marital sexual activity when one rejects either as morally wrong is associated with a greater likelihood of reporting unhappiness. Analyses demonstrated that American men (but not women) who reported engaging in same-sex sex in the previous year were more likely than other men to say they were unhappy, but only if they viewed homosexuality as “always wrong.” Analyses also showed that American women (not men) who reported higher frequencies of non-marital sex in the previous year were more likely than other women to report being unhappy, but only if they viewed non-marital sex as “always wrong.” Though nuanced by gender, findings affirmed expectations from moral incongruence research: Sexual behavior per se is not associated with unhappiness, but moral inconsistency or conflict regarding one’s sexual behavior is.},

The current article reviews how pornography use is likely relevant to various domains within psychological science, particularly emphasizing its significance in relationship research, adolescentdevelopment research, and clinical science. Specifically, pornography use is likely salient to research examining both sexual and romantic satisfaction. Additionally, it is also likely relevant to understanding adolescent sexual development, particularly among sexual-minority populations. Finally, a large body of research suggests that pornography use may become problematic, either because of excessive use or moral incongruence about such use, illustrating its salience in clinical psychological science. Collectively, the current research related to pornography use suggests that it is of interest to multiple domains in psychological science and that its effects can range from positive to neutral to negative.},

While prior research suggests US military veterans may experience disproportional rates of problematic pornography use, few comparative studies exist. Moreover, no measurement invariance analyses between veterans and non-veterans exist on measures designed to assess problematic pornography use. The purposes of the present report were to explore whether differences exist between veteran and non-veteran men on indices of problematic pornography use, determine whether veteran status is associated with an exacerbation of psychological distress in conjunction with problematic pornography use, and establish measurement invariance psychometric data between veteran and non-veteran men on the Brief Pornography Screen (Kraus et al., 2020). We analyzed data drawn from a nationally representative panel of men from the USA (N = 658 nonveterans, N = 186 veterans). When adjusting for age, veteran men experienced significantly more problematic pornography use compared to non-veteran men. A substantial moderation effect was also evident, with veterans experiencing significantly more psychological distress associated with their problematic pornography use (β = .65) compared to non-veterans (β = .29), while adjusting for age and pornography use frequency. The Brief Pornography Screen demonstrated residual invariance (i.e., measurement equivalence of factor structure, loadings, intercepts, and errors) between veteran and non-veteran men. Clinicians working with veterans should explore how pornography use is related to their mental health. The Brief Pornography Screen is an effective tool to assess problematic pornography viewing in veteran and non-veteran men.},

	abstract = {Religiously conservative Americans consistently demonstrate lower scientific literacy than other Americans. Some argue, however, that Americans’ scientific literacy is contingent on subcultural conflict, showing differences in scientific literacy that emerge only on religiously contested scientific claims. Building on these insights, we find that the most salient factor explaining Americans’ divergence on contested (though not on uncontested) scientific claims is not religious commitment or conservatism per se, but an ideology that seeks political—and consequently epistemic—dominance: Christian nationalism. National data show that Christian nationalism is unassociated with Americans’ answers on questions about uncontested scientific knowledge. However, Christian nationalism is the strongest predictor of incorrect answers on questions about religiously contested scientific claims. Contemporary “culture war” debates over science have little to do with outright ignorance of science, nor are they strictly about religiosity or theological conservatism.

This study uses national data to examine whether Christian nationalism could potentially convert the previously-unconverted to supporting Trump or, conversely, prevent apostatizing from Trump. Among Americans who did not vote for Trump in 2016, Christian nationalism increased the likelihood that they intended to vote for Trump in 2020, but only those who earlier did not vote at all or voted third party. Conversely, among Americans who did vote for Trump in 2016, Christian nationalism reduced the likelihood that they planned on voting for a Democratic or third party candidate. Christian nationalism thus potentially inclined Americans who previously did not vote for Trump in 2016 to vote his way in 2020 and inoculated previous Trump-voters from considering other candidates in 2020.},

However, presently, very few published articles have considered the relationship between Gambling Disorder and negative aspects of religion and spirituality such as religious and spiritual struggles. This study aimed to better understand how problem gambling severity may be uniquely associated with religious and spiritual struggles, both cross-sectionally and over time. The study used secondary data from a longitudinal MTurk Survey (n = 764; follow-up n = 342) and controlled for neuroticism, age, gender, income, and gambling preference. Problem gambling severity was uniquely associated with several types of religious and spiritual struggles at baseline and most struggles at a six-month follow-up, even after controlling for baseline levels of such struggles. Further research is necessary to understand the nature of these links and how they might inform clinical care.},

	abstract = {Of the many changes in daily life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts and governmentally mandated lockdowns were among the most drastic. Coinciding with these changes, popular pornography websites made some previously premium content available for free, spurring dramatic increases in traffic to these websites. This increase in time spent at home and reported increases in traffic to specific pornographic websites led to some speculation that pornography use might generally increase over the course of the pandemic and that problematic use might also increase. To test these speculations and quantify the effects of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on social behaviors on pornography use, we analyzed data from a longitudinal sample of American adults. Baseline, nationally representative data were collected in August 2019 via YouGov (N = 2518). Subsequent data were collected in February 2020 (n = 1677), May 2020 (n = 1533), August 2020 (n = 1470), and October 2020 (n = 1269). Results indicated that, in May 2020, immediately following the height of the first wave of pandemic-related lockdowns, more people reported past-month pornography use than at other follow-up time points, but less did so than at baseline. Among those who reported use in May 2020, only 14\% reported increases in use since the start of the pandemic, and their use returned to levels similar to all other users by August 2020. In general, pornography use trended downward over the pandemic, for both men and women. Problematic pornography use trended downward for men and remained low and unchanged in women. Collectively, these results suggest that many fears about pornography use during pandemic-related lockdowns were largely not supported by available data.},

Across three studies (total N = 719), two of which used daily diaries (daily reports = 1,980), correlations, confirmatory factor analyses, and multilevel path models together showed that higher levels of authenticity related positively to presence of meaning and negatively to struggle with ultimate meaning at the between- and within-person levels. These findings are consistent with humanistic, existential, and positive psychology theories of authenticity and meaning and raise the possibility that increasing authenticity states over time may predict sustained improvement in multiple aspects of meaning.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review Pornography use is a common recreational activity in most developed nations with unrestricted internet access. As public awareness of pornography’s popularity has grown, so have concerns about potentially deleterious effects of pornography. One domain of particular concern has been the impact of pornography use and online sexual behaviors on sexual wellbeing. Over recent years, a number of studies have examined how pornography use relates to sexual wellbeing. The present work seeks to review such literature, with a particular focus on the effects of pornography on sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction. To this end, a systematic review of recent research (within the past 5 years) was conducted. Recent Findings A total of 44 articles were included in the systematic review. In some situations, pornography use is associated with greater sexual functioning and greater sexual satisfaction, and in other cases it seems to be associated with lower sexual functioning and lower sexual satisfaction. Specifically, mere pornography use itself was most often not associated with sexual functioning in either direction, but self-reported problematic use of pornography was consistently associated with more sexual functioning problems. Summary Collectively, results suggest a nuanced understanding of the effects of pornography on sexual wellbeing, with the context of and perceptions about pornography use being extremely important in predicting whether or not pornography has negative effects.},

	abstract = {During the COVID‐19 pandemic, Americans' behavioral responses were quickly politicized. Those on the left stressed precautionary behaviors, while those on the (religious) right were more likely to disregard recommended precautions. We propose the far right response was driven less by partisanship or religiosity per se, but rather by an ideology that connects disregard for scientific expertise; a conception of Americans as God's chosen and protected people; distrust for news media; and allegiance to Trump―Christian nationalism. Analyzing panel data collected in the thick of the COVID‐19 crisis, we find Christian nationalism was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in incautious behavior like eating in restaurants, visiting family/friends, or gathering with 10+ persons (though not attending church), and was the second strongest predictor that Americans took fewer precautions like wearing a mask or sanitizing/washing one's hands. Religiosity, in contrast, was the leading predictor that Americans engaged in more frequent precautionary behaviors. Findings document that Christian nationalism, not religious commitment per se, undergirded the far‐right response to COVID‐19 that disregarded precautionary recommendations, thus potentially worsening the pandemic.

	abstract = {For decades now and particularly during the 2020 presidential campaign, American conservatives have stressed the need to protect “religious freedom.” Building on research documenting a connection between Trump‐support, a desire to privilege conservative Christianity, and perceptions that conservative Christianity is persecuted due to its anti‐LGT (lesbian, gay, or transgender) views, we theorise such factors were the ideological driving force behind prioritising “religious freedom” in the 2020 presidential election. Drawing on national survey data from just after the November election, we find Christian nationalism and perceptions of anti‐Christian discrimination are strong predictors that (1) Americans feel “religious freedom” was an important factor influencing their vote and (2) that they ranked it the single greatest factor influencing their vote. In contrast, the perception that LGT persons are {\textless}italic{\textgreater}not{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} discriminated against also predicts viewing religious freedom as important, as does a perception of anti‐Semitism, but never perceptions of anti‐atheist or anti‐Muslim discrimination. Findings suggest conservative Christian supremacism, fear of (Judeo‐)Christian persecution and belief that LGT persons are privileged are ideological antecedents of votes for “religious freedom.” [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Pornography’s effects have received renewed attention, with particular concern about how viewing impacts committed partner relationships. Given that secrecy and deception about pornography viewing are linked with negative relationship outcomes, we sought to identify variables associated with persons’ endorsement of hiding it. We explored this in two studies. Results from a regression analysis suggest that consumer moral disapproval of pornography and experiences of shame were associated with hiding behavior. Results from a path analysis suggest that the positive relationship between sexual conservatism and endorsement of hiding viewing from one’s committed partner is mediated by both moral incongruence (associated with viewing) and perception that pornography causes a host of harms. Persons with moral qualms related to their viewing were especially likely to endorse hiding it if they were shame-prone. These findings point to the importance of sexual values and shame in relation to persons hiding their viewing; they also suggest that individuals who internalize messaging that pornography causes serious harms are more likely to keep their viewing secret. This suggests that practitioners, policymakers, and advocates need to be circumspect about their messaging, avoiding shame-inducing rhetoric, while keeping in mind the centrality of people’s values in informing attitudes and behaviors about pornography.},

Such attention has included a focus on potential comorbidities, risk factors, or symptoms resulting from such behaviours, including anxiety. Anxiety disorders have long been noted as comorbid with many other diagnoses, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and substance use disorders. This review aims to understand the relationship between anxiety and compulsive sexual behaviour in adults and adolescents, based on available quantitative studies. A search of PsycInfo and PubMed revealed 36 studies which quantitatively assessed a relationship between an anxiety measure and a Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder measure, including dissertations and published articles using clinical and community samples. A qualitative synthesis of the studies was conducted, rather than a meta-analysis, due to the variety of methods. Overall, studies were primarily cross-sectional and the relationship between these two constructs was unclear, likely due to several factors, including inconsistent measurement of Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder, lack of gender diversity, and very little longitudinal data. Directions for future research are discussed.},

But as the terms have become more mainstream, researchers have yet to examine the social and ideological correlates of actually describing oneself as “anti-racist.” Drawing on nationally representative survey data fielded at the height of national interest in “antiracist/anti-racist” language, the authors find that Blacks and Hispanics are significantly less likely than whites to describe themselves as “anti-racist,” and only the “very liberal” are more likely than other political orientations to identify with the label. Considering ideological correlates, progressive racial ideology is the strongest predictor of identifying as “anti-racist.” However, the second strongest correlate is describing oneself as “color-blind.” Analyses of quadratic terms suggests that this correlation is curvilinear for nonwhites but more linear for whites. Although originally conveying more radical and subversive ideals, those currently most likely to self-describe as “anti-racist” are white progressives with what we call “generically liberal” racial views.},

	abstract = {Sociologists have long identified a “perception gap” between Black and White Americans regarding racial injustice, often emphasizing either “epistemologies of ignorance” or “religio-cultural” mechanisms. Integrating and extending these insights, we theorize that conceptions of America’s religio-cultural heritage and identity are racially coded and grounded in White supremacy, but only for those atop the racial hierarchy. From this, we predict the perception gap is largely driven by Whites’ racialized idealization of their own religio-cultural preeminence in American civic life—what we call “White Christian nationalism.” Drawing on nationally representative data with currently relevant measures of Americans’ perceptions of racial injustice, we show the more Whites affirm seemingly race-neutral statements promoting Christianity’s preeminence in American life, the more they affirm White victimhood and deny anti-Black injustice. This association seems to drive the perception gap. Specifically, for Whites, Christian nationalism is powerfully associated with refusing to acknowledge anti-Black discrimination while affirming supposed anti-White discrimination; lower likelihood of attributing Ahmaud Arbery’s murder to racism or to even know about the incident; and greater likelihood of denying racial inequality in policing. For Black Americans, however, affirming the same measures of Christian nationalism produces no consistent change in their recognition of racial injustice. Thus, for Whites, appeals to America’s “Christian” heritage are racially coded and contribute to an ideological defense of White supremacy, including the denial of blatant anti-Black injustice and a commitment to White victimhood.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Throughout history, ideas about addiction have been informed and influenced by religious belief and practice. Even continuing into the present, religion and spirituality are often thought to impact attitudes towards addiction and its treatment, particularly given the use of religion and spirituality in various well-known treatments such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Although research has flourished with regards to the role that addiction and spirituality might play in vulnerability to addiction or the treatment of addiction, there has been comparatively less research examining how religion might impact attitudes toward addiction more broadly.
Method
The present work sought to examine the current state of empirical literature evaluating the relationships between religion and attitudes toward addiction and addiction treatment. In service of the above aim, a scoping review was conducted.
Results
This summary of peer-reviewed, quantitative studies (n=36) found that higher religiosity is related to more belief in the disease model of addiction in providers, negative attitudes towards addiction, and a stronger support for spiritually based treatments. However, results varied based on the measures used and many relationships tested were not significant. There also appeared to be differences in the interaction between religion and spirituality and other variables, such as the respondent’s sex or whether the individual was a student or provider, in terms of attitudes.
Conclusions
Further research is needed to fully understand the nuances in the relationship between these variables, including more clear operationalization and standardized measurement. Until such research is conducted, no cohesive conclusions can be drawn, and clinical implications remain unclear.},

	abstract = {Religious right leaders often promulgate views of Christianity's historical preeminence, privilege, and persecution in the United States that are factually incorrect, suggesting credulity, ignorance, or perhaps, a form of ideologically motivated ignorance on the part of their audience. This study examines whether Christian nationalism predicts explicit misconceptions regarding religion in American political history and explores theories about the connection. Analyzing nationally representative panel data containing true/false statements about religion's place in America's founding documents, policies, and court decisions, Christian nationalism is the strongest predictor that Americans fail to affirm factually correct answers. This association is stronger among whites compared to black Americans and religiosity actually predicts selecting factually correct answers once we account for Christian nationalism. Analyses of “do not know” response patterns find more confident correct answers from Americans who reject Christian nationalism and more confident incorrect answers from Americans who embrace Christian nationalism. We theorize that, much like conservative Christians have been shown to incorrectly answer science questions that are “religiously contested,” Christian nationalism inclines Americans to affirm factually incorrect views about religion in American political history, likely through their exposure to certain disseminators of such misinformation, but also through their allegiance to a particular political-cultural narrative they wish to privilege.},

In Study 2, results from a weighted, nationally-representative cross-section of U.S. adults (N = 2,519; Mean age = 47.5, SD = 17.8; 51.4\% women) found that prestige motivated grandstanding was reliably related to both ideological extremism and affective polarization.},

	abstract = {This project focused on religious/spiritual (r/s) struggles reported by U.S. adults around the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Presidential elections. Two separate samples of U.S. Mechanical Turk workers completed surveys about the 2016 (N = 504) and 2020 (N = 618) elections, with cross-sectional data collected between each election and the inauguration. Overall levels of r/s struggle were similar between the two elections. In 2016, Democratic voters (those voting for Clinton) struggled more than Republican voters (those voting for Trump), whereas in 2020, Trump and Biden voters struggled at similar levels. In both elections, interpersonal struggles around religion were the top-rated r/s struggle for Democratic voters, whereas Republican voters showed a more even balance of struggles (divine, demonic, interpersonal, moral, ultimate meaning, and doubt). Yet, aside from these straightforward differences in struggle based on whether one’s preferred candidate won or lost, correlations, regressions, and path models revealed similar predictors of struggle across both elections: more negative reactions to election results, greater religiousness, more demonic attributions, more divine attributions (especially negative attributions about God’s intent), more right-wing authoritarianism (specifically, authoritarian aggression/submission; clearest in 2020), and more anger at both Democrats and Republicans. Taken together, these findings suggest that major societal events such as Presidential elections have the potential to trigger r/s struggles for many individuals. Given the current level of political polarization in the U.S., along with the many ways in which politics and religion can become intertwined, the nature, causes, and consequences of politically focused r/s struggles merit more research attention.
