Public discourse is often quite caustic and problematic, particularly when the focus of such discourse is on morally charged or politically salient topics.  To better understand some aspects of this discourse, recent work in philosophy has focused on a new construct, Moral Grandstanding, as a potential explanatory mechanism. Specifically, moral grandstanding (hereafter, MG) refers to the use of moral talk to impress others or the abuse of moral talk to seek social status. That is, moral grandstanding refers to the use and abuse of moral talk to improve ones status, rank, or position in social groups.  

Through a combination of funding efforts supported, in part, by the Charles Koch Foundation, the National Institute for Civil Discourse, the Institute for Humane Studies, and Bowling Green State University, this project seeks to examine, using psychosocial research, how moral grandstanding is experienced and expressed in the public.
