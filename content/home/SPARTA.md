The SPARTA lab (Science of Personality, Addiction, and Religion, Throughout Adulthood) at Bowling Green State University is comprised of myself, my current graduate students, and a number of undergraduate students. At this point in time, our research group has several lines of research in various stages of development. Current projects include studies of sexual values, morality and pornography use, self-determination theory and religion, sexuality and spiritual functioning, and social determinants of beliefs about addiction.  Current graduate student members of our lab include Jenny Grant, Joel Engelman, Shanti James, Brinna Lee, Camille Hoagland, and (as of Fall 2021) Chris Floyd.

We are hoping to add one additional graduate student lab member for the Fall of 2022. If you are interested in applying to work with us in the SPARTA Lab, information on applying to BGSU's clinical psychology PhD program is available here: https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/graduate-program/prospective-students.html

Please note, the deadline for application is December 1st, 2021.
