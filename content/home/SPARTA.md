The SPARTA lab (Science of Personality, Addiction, and Religion, Throughout Adulthood) at Bowling Green State University is comprised of myself and my current graduate students. At this point in time, our research groups has several lines of research in various stages of development. Current projects include examininations of pathological gambling and religious and spiritual wellbeing, examinations of the process and effects of leaving a religious group, studies of sexuality and spiritual functioning, and studies of how self-perception influences one's interpretation of their own behaviors.  Current members of our lab include Brandon Gordon, Jenny Grant, Joel Engelman, Shanti James, and Brinna Price.

We are hoping to add one additional lab member for the Fall of 2019. If you are interested in applying to work with us in the SPARTA Lab, information on applying to BGSU's clinical psychology PhD program is available here: https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/graduate-program/prospective-students.html

Please note, the deadline for application is December 1st, 2018.
