The BAAAD lab (Behavioral Addictions and Associated Disorders) at the University of New Mexico is comprised of myself, my current graduate students, and a number of undergraduate students. At this point in time, our research group has several lines of research in various stages of development. Current projects include studies of gambling behaviors, compulsive sexual behavior, sexual values, morality and pornography use, self-determination theory, and social determinants of beliefs about addiction.  Current graduate student members of our lab include Regina Tahk and Alex Connolly.
