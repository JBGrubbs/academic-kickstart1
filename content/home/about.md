# Biography

My research (and the research of the SPARTA lab) falls primarily into three domains: the psychology of religion and spirituality, the psychology of human sexuality, and the psychology of addiction.  With regards to religion and spirituality, I have a particular interest in the religious and spiritual struggles, crises of faith, religiously-based moral emotions, feelings of doubt or exit from faith, and the role of personality in shaping religious and spiritual experiences.  With regards to the psychology of human sexuality, I am very interested in the role that technology plays in shaping human sexual behaviors. To this end, I have a number of ongoing research projects examining internet pornography use and online sexuality.  Finally, in regards to addiction, I have past and ongoing projects related to perceived addiction to internet pornography, hypersexual behavior more broadly, and pathological gambling.  In addition to these domains, I am also interested in the Open Science movement more broadly and in promoting replicability, reproducibility, and transparency in the scientific process.  I strive to conduct my research in accordance with current standards of transparency and openness, and I encourage my students to do the same. You can find more information about my current projects at my Open Science Framework page (https://osf.io/c8hxw/) and a complete list of my publications at my Google Scholar page (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gCnmj3kAAAAJ&hl=en).
