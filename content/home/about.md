# Biography
I am currently an assistant professor in the APA Accredited Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program at Bowling Green State University.

My research (and the research of the SPARTA lab) falls primarily into three domains: the scientific study of addiction, personality, and religion (particularly as it relates to addiction and personality).

With regards to addiction, I am particularly interested in topics related to behavioral addictions or compulsive behavior batterns. My specific interest in these domains are in the social and structural factors that shape self-perception and how self-reported beliefs about addiction influence presentation of symptoms, which, in turn, influence diagnosis, classification, and treatment of addictive behaviors.  In short, I am interested in how society and environment affect self-perception of addictive behaviors and how that self-perception interacts with the addiction.  I have past and ongoing projects related to self-reported problematic internet pornography use, hypersexual behavior more broadly, and pathological gambling.  

With regards to personality, I am particularly interested in the role that specific personality traits play in influencing the experience and expression of psychopathology.

With regards to religion and spirituality, I have a particular interest in the religious and spiritual struggles, crises of faith, religiously-based moral emotions, feelings of doubt or exit from faith, and the role of personality in shaping religious and spiritual experiences. Specifically, I am interested in what people experience when religion "goes wrong." 

In addition to these domains, I am also interested in the Open Science movement and in promoting replicability, reproducibility, and transparency in the scientific process.  I strive to conduct my research in accordance with current standards of transparency and openness, and I encourage my students to do the same. You can find more information about my current projects at my Open Science Framework page (link available below profile picture) and a complete list of my publications at my Google Scholar page (link available below profile picture).
