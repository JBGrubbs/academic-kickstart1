Brandon is currently a fourth year student in the clinical psychology Ph.D. program at BGSU. 

Brandon primarily studies how Eastern religions affect mental health. More specifically, he investigates how Tantric Buddhism and other Tantric traditions affect people's quality of romantic relationships. The title of his Master's thesis is "Development and Validation of a Tantric Sex Scale." He plans to expand his research into hypo-egoic phenomena and how selflessness is related to individual well-being.
