I am currently a second year student in the clinical psychology Ph.D. program at BGSU. My research interests are varied, but tend to focus on topics of addiction and religion/spirituality. Below, I have included information regarding my masters thesis project.

The Effect of Gambling on Religious and Spiritual Struggles

Religious and spiritual (r/s) struggles are known to be associated with various self-reported addictions, such as pornography and substance use (Grubbs, Exline, Pargament, Volk, & Lindberg, 2014; Faigin, Pargament, & Abu-Raiya, 2014). This study aims to understand how r/s struggles (Exline, Pargament, Grubbs, & Yali, 2014) are affected by the severity of an individualâ€™s gambling problems. Using secondary data, we are planning to use hierarchical regression analyses to find out whether an increase in gambling problem severity predicts more r/s struggles (looking at each of the six struggles separately). In doing so, we will be controlling for characteristics which are known to be associated with higher r/s struggles.
